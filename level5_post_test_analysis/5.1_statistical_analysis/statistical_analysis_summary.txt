HYPOTHESIS TESTING RESULTS
==========================
ANOVA F-statistic: 1693.4956
ANOVA P-value: 0.000000
✓ Significant difference between protocols (p < 0.05)

PAIRWISE COMPARISONS (Bonferroni corrected):
• wireguard vs openvpn: 526.0 Mbps higher (p = 0.000000)
• wireguard vs ipsec: 365.6 Mbps higher (p = 0.000000)
• openvpn vs ipsec: 160.3 Mbps lower (p = 0.000000)

KEY FINDINGS:
• WireGuard shows highest mean throughput with tight confidence intervals
• OpenVPN has lower throughput but good consistency
• IPSec provides balanced performance between the two extremes
• All protocols show statistically significant performance differences

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
• WireGuard is statistically superior for throughput performance
• IPSec offers a good balance for enterprise environments
• OpenVPN remains viable for compatibility-focused deployments
